# Full Isaac Omniverse Simulation Pipeline for Megatron Humanoid Gait Training

This repository fully integrates NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Omniverse USD pipeline, and Groot N1 foundation models to train Megatron humanoid gaits using human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning.

## Components Included:
- USD scene building for Megatron humanoid
- Groot N1 pretrained model loading and testing
- Terrain generation and difficulty scaling
- Human-in-the-loop simulation controls
- Isaac Gym RL integration

## Usage Workflow:
1. Generate Megatron humanoid scene.
2. Load Groot N1 models.
3. Run interactive training loop with terrain scaling.
4. Visualize gait performance.
5. Deploy to real or simulated hardware.
